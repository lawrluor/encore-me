        <p>Encore was created to answer a question: What makes strangers invested in a performance? How do they know that the next song will be something they really enjoy?</p>


        <p>With Encore, performers have a way to share what the next song might be, and audiences have a way to request that song before they leave. All without disturbing the natural flow of a live performance.</p>
